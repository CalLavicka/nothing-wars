Game for LD45

A turn-based strategy game where the units start from nothing and must be upgraded to be useful! Capture cities with your commander to get more tanks, but be careful, as if you lose your commander, you lose the game! Destroy the opposing commander to win!

Controls: Click to select units / move / attack. Press 's'/'d'/'h' to upgrade a tank instead of attacking. Press 'c' to capture a city with your commander.
